iExec allows Ethereum developers to create applications that can be executed off-chain. The [iExec SDK](https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-sdk) brings all the tools to develop, deploy and execute Dapps on Ethereum and iExec. Using these tools, you will be able to deploy any legacy applications in the iExec infrastructure and execute them through calls to Ethereum smart contracts.

In this tutorial, you will first deploy an application on the iExec platform, and then, you will submit a work to this dapp.

Ready? Let's go!
